## For working with single axis solar trackers


## Sample Data
I've included two days of solar tracking data on the same array type on the same location. 

The first day is a very poor solar day, with not much sun. 

The second day is a great solar day, but with a strong frost in the morning the messed with the optical sensors for most of the morning. 


The Array "NorthPI" is the array where the motor is controlled by the solarpi script. 

The Array "SouthPI" is the array where the motor is controlled by an optical tracker
